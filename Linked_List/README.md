# Linked List
 - Linked List is a linear data structure. 
 - Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
 - They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
 
 - Pros:
  - Lists are dynamic, they can grow or shrink depending on the situation.
  - Ease of Insertion/Deletion.
  
 - Cons: 
   - Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node(head node).
   - Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.

 - Functions:
  - delete() to delete a certain element
  - add() to add an element at the end or top 
  - insert() to insert an element at a certain position
