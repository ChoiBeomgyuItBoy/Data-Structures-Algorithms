# Linear Search
 - Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm. 
 
 - Starts at one end and goes through each element of a collection until the desired element is found, the search continues till the end of the data set.
 
 - Complexity:
   - Time - O(n) 
   - Space - O(n)
   
 - Pros:
   - Fast for searches of small to medium data sets.
   - Does't need to be sorted.
   - Useful for data structures that don't have random access (Linked Lists)
   
 - Cons:
   - Slow for large data sets.

 - **It is the easiest searching algorithm**.
