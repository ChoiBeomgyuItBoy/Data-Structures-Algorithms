# Queue - FIFO
- A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is the     first person who gets the ticket.
- Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.
- It's a collection desgined for holding elements prior to processsing.
- Functions:
  - enqueue() to add an element to the end of the queue
  - dequeue() to remove an element from the front of the queue
