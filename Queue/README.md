# Queue - FIFO
  - A queue is a useful data structure in programming. It is similar to the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the first person entering the queue is        the first person who gets the ticket.

  - Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule - the item that goes in first is the item that comes out first.

  - It's a collection desgined for holding elements prior to processsing.

  - Complexity;
     - Time: O(1) - for enqueue and dequeue.
     - Space: O(1) - no extra memory required for operations.

  - Pros:
     - Very fast in operating data.
     - Helpful in managing user needs.

  - Cons:
     - A new element cannot be inserted without the deletion of the old element.
     
  - Operations:
     - enqueue() to add an element to the end of the queue
     - dequeue() to remove an element from the front of the queue
